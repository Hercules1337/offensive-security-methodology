# Offensive Security Methodology

This repository documents my structured approach to penetration testing engagements.

It is designed as a repeatable decision framework rather than a collection of tools or exploits.

The objective is to maintain discipline during enumeration, access development, privilege escalation, and reporting.

## Engagement Lifecycle

Recon &rarr; Enumeration &rarr; Access &rarr; PrivEsc &rarr; Post-Exploitation &rarr; Reporting

### 1. Surface Mapping
Identify exposed services and define the attack surface.

### 2. Access Development
Convert misconfigurations or vulnerabilities into controlled access.

### 3. Privilege Expansion
Escalate privileges through structured local enumeration and trust abuse.

### 4. Post-Exploitation
Assess impact, credential exposure, and lateral movement opportunities.

### 5. Reporting
Translate technical findings into actionable remediation.
